THIS DOCUMENT IS TO SHOW WHICH ITEMS IN THE CURRENT MOCK UP NEED TO BE REPLACED

-Currently the mockup uses Oracle and nrs-projects to execute the php, this connection string will need to be replaced once the hosting for the website and db is up and running

-It also currently uses nrs-projects accounts for log in credentials, these credentials will need to be replaced with library staff members
	--Will we need to implement a login portion of the database in order to ensure correct access to the app?

-Home currently has no content other than navigation. What would people like to have inside the content here?

- data-collection.php currently has a place holder select menu that needs to be replaced by a select item populated by layouts from the database dependant on the floor that is selected.

- data-collection.php needs to have a javascript application developed for taking information from the imported layout, converting it into a usable, scrollable ui, and then take information and relay it back to the end user after a report is commited

- query-report.php has several place holder select menu's that need to be replaced by select menus populated from the DB. These include:
						The date select menu
						The time select menu
						The floor select menu
						The user select menu (people who took reports)
						ect...
						This will require ajax and javascript to properly implement and function just as data-collection.php will.
